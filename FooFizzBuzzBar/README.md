Print the numbers from 1 to 1,000 inclusive, each on their own line.

If, however, the number is a multiple of two then print Foo instead, if the number is a multiple of three then print Fizz, if the number is a multiple of five then print Buzz, and if the number is a multiple of seven then print Bar.

If multiple conditions hold true then all replacements should be printed, for example 15 should print FizzBuzz.
