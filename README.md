# Code Golf â›³
[Code Golf](https://code.golf/) challenges

The idea is to complete the "hole" (i.e. challenge) in the least amount of characters and/or bytes possible.
This approach throws the best coding practices out the window, but is a good exercise to look at a problem in a different light and try to optimize the code as much as possible.

Each directory represents one challenge, the README inside explains the rules for the challenge and the script is my best attempt to solving it without recurring at looking for a solution online.
